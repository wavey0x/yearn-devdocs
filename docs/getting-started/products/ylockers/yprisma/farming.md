# yPRISMA FAQ

The Prisma Wars are officially underway, which means full steam ahead for yPRISMA: Yearn's newest tokenized locker product.

Yearn has claimed its PRISMA airdrop as yPRISMA and is preparing to distribute these tokens to yCRV users and yPRISMA LPs. 

This post will outline exactly how that will work.

### What's happening with Yearn's veCRV Airdrop?

The roughly 280,000 yPRISMA tokens minted from Yearn's airdrop claim will be distributed across two simple staking contracts: yCRV and yPRISMA LPs.

If you are a user in the yCRV ecosystem, you may migrate your position by withdrawing to vanilla yCRV and depositing it into the new staking contract on https://yprisma.yearn.fi to earn yPRISMA rewards.

## What do I do with yPRISMA?

The yPRISMA ecosystem aims to deliver a user experience similar to yCRV, which passes all protocol yield earned by Yearn's position along to users.

There is a staking contract available on the [yPRISMA website](https://yprisma.yearn.fi/) which allows users to stake their yPRISMA to earn protocol fees and bribes.

## Can yPRISMA users vote in Primsa?

Weekly incentive voting is automated to optimize for max weekly bribe yield.
In regard to Prisma governance proposals, there is active research being done to determine how to pass Yearn's voting power along to yPRISMA users.
